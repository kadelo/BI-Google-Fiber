# Google Fiber BI Case Study

This repository showcases the application of Business Intelligence (BI) principles in a simulated workplace scenario for Google Fiber. The project focuses on improving customer satisfaction by analyzing and visualizing trends in customer support interactions.

# Project Objective

As part of a BI Analyst role simulation, the goal was to design an accessible, insightful dashboard to help stakeholders:

- Analyze repeat customer calls after initial inquiries.
- Identify problem types generating the most repeat calls.
- Explore regional trends in repeat calls across three market cities.


# Key Deliverables

Using anonymized and fictionalized data, the project produced:

- Repeat Call Analysis: Visualizations of repeat calls by their initial contact date.
- Problem Type Insights: Data on issues causing repeat interactions.
- Market Comparison: Trends by week, month, and quarter for three service areas.
  
The dashboard aligns with stakeholder requirements and was designed to support data-driven decisions for reducing call volume and enhancing operational efficiency. While accessibility was a key focus (e.g., large text and text-to-speech alternatives), some features could not be fully implemented due to Tableau's tool limitations.
